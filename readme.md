# Transfoam Metabolic Modeling

<h3>Instructions</h3>

COBRApy
* navigate to transfoam/bioreactor/library and activate virtual environment with 'source ../env/bin/activate'
	- start jupyter lab with 'jupyter lab'
	- run notebooks
		- model.ipynb adds plasmid reactions to model
		- data.ipynb extracts model data
		- yield.ipynb is for FBA and knockout analysis

MATLAB
* add transfoam/matlab to working path
	- run scripts
		- mostly for robustness analysis and optpipe

R
* open r.Rproj in RStudio
	- run scripts
		- figure generation with ggplot
